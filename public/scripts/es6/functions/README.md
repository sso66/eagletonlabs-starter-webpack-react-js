## The Chronicles of JavaScript Functions
### All about JavaScript / ES6+ Functions
#### What is a Function?
 - A function that does not take a parameter and doesn't return anything.
 - A function that does take a parameter and doesn't return anything.
 - A function that does not take a parameter and returns a value.
 - A function that does taka a paramenter and returns a value.
#### Functions are first-class objects
#### A function can take more than one arguments (in fact, it can take 'n+1' parameters)
 - How to write a function that take 'n+1' arguments?
 - How does it work?
 - What does `...args` does?
#### Practical applications (solutions) of callback functions!
#### A function can call itself (aka recursion) 
#### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (aka IIEF)
 - Where can IIEF be used?
#### Technical Notes:
`All functions are objects but not all objects are functions. What distingushes the 
function from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are 
Function objects.`
#### Objects and Functions (call, apply and bind)
 - Using call() method to invoke a method on another object.
 - Using apply() method to invoke a method on another object.
 - Using bind() method.
#### Constructor Function
 - Why use prototype for adding instance methods?
 - Providing protection against missing 'new' for invoking constructor function.
 - How to return a custom object from a Constructor function?
 - Singleton Design Pattern
#### Closures
 - Applications of Closures
  - Partial Application
  - Event Handlers
  - Ajax
  - Private methods
